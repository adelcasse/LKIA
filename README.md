My IAs for the game LeekWars (http://leekwars.com/)

I have 2 leeks :
================

### Chouchreau :  

Level 10

#### Uses :

 * weapon : DOUBLE GUN
 * chips : BANDAGE, ICE, SHOCK

### 4.0 : 

Level 53

#### Uses :

 * weapon : MAGNUM
 * chips : PEBBLE, SPARK, ICE, BANDAGE, HELMET, PROTEIN, CURE, STRETCHING, FLAME, MOTIVATION, STEROID

 (as it's not possible to use all these chips in the same time, it≈õ possible to disable some of them by putthing them in the array CHIPS_UNAVAILABLE)
